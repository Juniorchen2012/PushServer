# TODO

- [ ] authenticated client-initiated push notifications
- [ ] ability to add arbitrary push payload data using dashboard interface
- [ ] create a configurable way to use a long-lived apnsConnection in the case that an app sends many notifications over time to many channels with few subscribers (e.g. a messaging app)

### Done

- [x] incorporate Feedback service to mark device tokens as invalid in database
